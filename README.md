# FlappyBirdBlazor
A **FlappyBird** clone game under Blazor wasm with C#. 

# Playing the game
You control the little bird. You can make it climb by pressing ↑ (up), ⏎ (return), ␣ (space), or clicking into the window. Don't crash into any pipes! For every pipe you pass without colliding, you get one point.
